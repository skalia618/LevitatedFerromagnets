# Levitated Ferromagnets

This repository contains all the code used to generate the plots in arXiv:24XX.XXXXX.  If you have any questions, please contact Saarik Kalia (kalias@umn.edu).

The files in this repository generate the following figures.
- axelectron_projection.py: Top left plot of Fig. 6
- axphoton_projection.py: Bottom plot of Fig. 6
- DPDM_projection.py: Top right plot of Fig. 6
- eigenvals.py: Left plots of Figs. 1 and 2
- elements.py: Right plots of Figs. 1 and 2
- pickupcoil.py: Fig. 3 (the figure in the paper is a slightly cropped version)
- sensitivity.py: All plots of Fig. 5

In addition, params.py is used by the projection and sensitivity codes to compute quantities for the different setups specified in Table 1.

The *_constraints/ folders contain constraints used in plotting the projections.
